   * subclass of Leap::Listener to the controller to handle events as they occur.
   * The Controller dispatches events to the listener upon initialization and exiting,
   * on connection changes, when the application gains and loses the OS input focus,
   * and when a new frame of tracking data is available.
   * When these events occur, the controller object invokes the appropriate
   * callback function defined in your subclass of Listener.
   *
   * To access frames of tracking data as they become available:
   *
   * 1. Implement a subclass of the Listener class and override the
   *    Listener::onFrame() function.
   * 2. In your Listener::onFrame() function, call the Controller::frame()
   *    function to access the newest frame of tracking data.
   * 3. To start receiving frames, create a Controller object and add an instance
   *    of the Listener subclass to the Controller::addListener() function.
   *
   * When an instance of a Listener subclass is added to a Controller object,
   * it calls the Listener::onInit() function when the listener is ready for use.
   * When a connection is established between the controller and the Leap Motion software,
   * the controller calls the Listener::onConnect() function. At this point, your
   * application will start receiving frames of data. The controller calls the
   * Listener::onFrame() function each time a new frame is available. If the
   * controller loses its connection with the Leap Motion software or device for any
   * reason, it calls the Listener::onDisconnect() function. If the listener is
   * removed from the controller or the controller is destroyed, it calls the
   * Listener::onExit() function. At that point, unless the listener is added to
   * another controller again, it will no longer receive frames of tracking data.
   *
   * The Controller object is multithreaded and calls the Listener functions on
   * its own thread, not on an application thread.
